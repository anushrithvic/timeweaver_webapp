# ⏱️ TimeWeaver
### Automated Timetable & Faculty Workload Optimization System

TimeWeaver is an intelligent academic scheduling platform that automatically generates **conflict-free timetables** while optimizing **faculty workload, classroom usage, and institutional constraints**.  
It transforms complex manual scheduling into an efficient, transparent, and error-free process.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Automated conflict-free timetable generation  
- ✅ Supports theory classes, labs, electives, and multi-section courses  
- ✅ Faculty workload balancing  
- ✅ Classroom & resource capacity optimization  
- ✅ Real-world institutional constraints handling  
- ✅ Unified optimization engine (constraints + optimization logic)  
- ✅ Interactive timetable visualization  
- ✅ Scalable and modular system design  

---

## 🧠 System Architecture

TimeWeaver uses a **single unified optimization engine** that:

- Models institutional rules as constraints  
- Applies optimization logic to generate feasible schedules  
- Automatically detects and resolves conflicts  
- Ensures balanced faculty workload distribution  

The frontend includes a **Visualization Module** to clearly display timetables and workload allocation.
