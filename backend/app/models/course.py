Course and Elective Group Database Models

This module defines two related SQLAlchemy models for academic course management:
1. ElectiveGroup - Groups of optional courses students can choose from
2. Course - Individual courses with theory/lab hour specifications

Epic 1: User Stories 1.4 and 1.5
- User Story 1.4: Define course details (theory hours, lab hours, credits)
- User Story 1.5: Define elective groups for student choice

Database Tables: elective_groups, courses

Relationships:
    - ElectiveGroup has many Courses (one-to-many)
    - Course belongs to one Department (many-to-one)
    - Course optionally belongs to one ElectiveGroup (many-to-one)
