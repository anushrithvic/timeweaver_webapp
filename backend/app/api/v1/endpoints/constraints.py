Constraints API Endpoints

This module provides RESTful CRUD operations and AI-powered explainability
for scheduling constraints in the TimeWeaver system.

Epic 1: User Story 1.2 - Set fixed rules and flexible preferences

Constraints are the foundation of the intelligent timetabling system. This API
allows administrators to define, manage, and understand scheduling rules.

**Special Features:**
- Full CRUD operations for constraint management
- Filtering by constraint type, hard/soft, and active status
- **AI Explainability**: `/explain` endpoint provides human-readable explanations
- Support for both hard constraints (must satisfy) and soft constraints (preferences)
- JSONB parameter storage for flexible constraint configuration

Endpoints:
    POST / - Create new constraint
    GET / - List constraints with filters
    GET /{id} - Get constraint details
    GET /{id}/explain - Get AI-generated explanation ⭐
    PUT /{id} - Update constraint
    DELETE /{id} - Delete constraint

The explainability feature makes the AI's decision-making transparent,
helping administrators understand why certain scheduling decisions are made.
